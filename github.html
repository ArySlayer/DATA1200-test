            <h3>Start of Collaboration</h3>
            <p>At the start of our collaboration, setting up GitHub went smoothly. We all successfully became collaborators, and the repository was shared among the team without any technical issues. Initially, everything worked as expected, and we felt confident about using version control to manage our project. However, as we began making individual changes and committing them, problems started to arise. Multiple team members unintentionally worked on overlapping sections of the code, which led to merge conflicts. These conflicts often resulted in overwritten changes or disrupted functionality, creating unnecessary delays in our workflow.</p>
 
            <h3>Agreements</h3>
            <p>To resolve these issues, we had to manually review the affected code, identify conflicting sections, and decide which changes to retain. This process was both time-consuming and frustrating but ultimately served as a valuable learning experience. We realized the importance of clear communication within the team and the need for well-defined version control practices. It also taught us the significance of planning and dividing tasks more effectively to avoid overlaps. Although these challenges tested our teamwork and problem-solving skills, they helped us develop a better understanding of GitHubâ€™s functionality and the importance of collaboration in a coding environment. This experience strengthened our ability to work cohesively as a team.</p>
