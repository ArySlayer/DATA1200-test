        <h3>Start of collaboration</h3>
     <p>At first we had no issues with setting up github, we all become collaborators. The problems started when we started commiting changes so some changes got overwritten or causing us to have conflicts in the code which we had to manually go in and approve the new changes.</p>

     <h3>Agreements</h3>
     <p>After all of the chaos with committing changes we all decided to only commit changes once we are together, and to do it one by one</p>
     
    <h2>Specific change</h1>
